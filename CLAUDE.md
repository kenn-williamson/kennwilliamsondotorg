## Context7 MCP Server Usage
When working on this project, use the Context7 MCP server to look up APIs and documentation:

### Current/Legacy Stack
1. **For Vue.js APIs**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "vue" to get Vue.js documentation
2. **For TypeScript**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "typescript" for TypeScript language features
3. **For Vite**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "vite" for build tool configuration

### New Full-Stack APIs
1. **For Nuxt.js**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "nuxt.js" for SSR, routing, and framework features
2. **For Rust/Actix-web**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "actix-web" for web framework documentation
3. **For PostgreSQL**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "postgresql" for database operations
4. **For Docker**: Use `resolve-library-id` with "docker" for containerization

## Development Notes

### Current Legacy App
- The app uses Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax
- Components are located in `src/components/` with a clean, modular structure
- TypeScript is configured for strict type checking
- Vite provides hot module replacement for fast development
- The project follows Vue.js best practices and conventions

### New Architecture Guidelines
- **Node.js 20+**: Required for Nuxt.js (even-numbered versions recommended)

## Development Workflow

### Docker Service Management
Use standard Docker Compose commands for service management:

```bash
# Build services
docker-compose build                 # Build all services
docker-compose build backend        # Build specific service
docker-compose build --no-cache     # Force rebuild

# Start services  
docker-compose up -d                 # Start all services
docker-compose up -d backend        # Start specific service

# Combined build and start
docker-compose up -d --build backend

# ⚠️  IMPORTANT: Always use .env.development for development
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up backend -d
docker-compose --env-file .env.development build backend

# Service status and logs
docker-compose ps                    # Service status
docker-compose --env-file .env.development logs backend         # View service logs with proper config
docker-compose --env-file .env.development logs -f backend      # Follow logs with proper config
docker-compose logs backend         # View service logs (basic, may miss debug logging)
docker-compose logs -f backend      # Follow logs (basic, may miss debug logging)
```

### Development Scripts
- `./scripts/reset-db.sh` - Complete database reset with fresh migrations
- `./scripts/setup-db.sh` - Run pending migrations safely (preserves data)
- `./scripts/prepare-sqlx.sh` - Generate SQLx query cache for Docker builds
- `./scripts/health-check.sh` - Comprehensive service health verification

### ⚠️ Environment File Usage (Critical for Debug Logging)
**Important**: For proper debug logging (HTTP requests, JWT middleware), containers must be started with the environment file:
```bash
# Start with proper environment configuration
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d backend

# Then view logs (now includes debug output)
docker-compose logs -f backend
```

### Common Development Workflows

**New Developer Setup:**
```bash
# 1. Start database
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up postgres -d

# 2. Run migrations
./scripts/setup-db.sh --verify

# 3. Prepare SQLx cache
./scripts/prepare-sqlx.sh

# 4. Build and start backend
docker-compose --env-file .env.development build backend
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d backend

# 5. Verify everything is healthy
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

**After Database Schema Changes:**
```bash
# 1. Run new migrations
./scripts/setup-db.sh

# 2. Update SQLx cache
./scripts/prepare-sqlx.sh --clean

# 3. Rebuild backend with new cache
docker-compose --env-file .env.development build backend
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d backend
```

**When Things Are Broken (Nuclear Reset):**
```bash
# 1. Reset database completely
./scripts/reset-db.sh

# 2. Prepare SQLx cache
./scripts/prepare-sqlx.sh

# 3. Rebuild everything
docker-compose --env-file .env.development build
docker-compose --env-file .env.development up -d

# 4. Verify health
./scripts/health-check.sh --wait
```

**Daily Development (New Simplified Workflow):**
```bash
# Start development environment
./scripts/dev-start.sh                    # Start all services
./scripts/dev-start.sh --build           # Force rebuild
./scripts/dev-start.sh --logs            # Start and follow logs

# Rebuild specific services
./scripts/dev-start.sh --rebuild backend    # Force recreate backend
./scripts/dev-start.sh --no-cache frontend # Rebuild frontend without cache

# View logs
./scripts/dev-logs.sh                    # Follow all logs
./scripts/dev-logs.sh backend           # Follow backend only
./scripts/dev-logs.sh --tail 50         # Show last 50 lines

# Stop services
./scripts/dev-stop.sh                   # Stop all services
./scripts/dev-stop.sh backend          # Stop specific service

# Health and maintenance
./scripts/health-check.sh               # Check service health
cd backend && cargo test               # Run tests
```

**Architecture:**
```
Development Stack:
┌─────────────────┐
│ Nginx Proxy     │ ← Port 80/443 (dev SSL)
│ :80 → :3000     │
│ :80/api → :8080 │
└─────────────────┘
         │
    ┌────┴────┐
    │         │
┌───▼───┐ ┌──▼──────┐
│Nuxt.js│ │ Rust    │
│Dev    │ │ API     │
│Server │ │ :8080   │
│:3000  │ │         │
└───────┘ └──┬──────┘
              │
        ┌─────▼─────┐
        │PostgreSQL │
        │   :5432   │
        └───────────┘
```

**Features:**
- **Volume Mounting**: Source code directories mounted for instant file changes
- **Hot Reload**: Nuxt dev server with HMR, Rust with cargo-watch auto-rebuild
- **Production Simulation**: Nginx proxy eliminates CORS issues, matches production routing
- **SSL Development**: Self-signed certificates for HTTPS development
- **Network Isolation**: Docker internal networking with exposed dev ports

**Development Experience:**
- Single `docker-compose up -d` starts entire development stack
- Code changes reflect immediately (no container rebuilds)
- Production-like URL structure: `https://localhost/api/health`
- Proper SSL certificate handling for auth testing
- No CORS configuration needed (same-origin requests)

**Implementation Plan:**
- **docker-compose.dev.yml**: Development-specific compose file
- **Volume Mounts**: Source directories attached to containers
- **nginx/dev.conf**: Development proxy configuration with self-signed SSL
- **Frontend**: Nuxt dev mode with `--host 0.0.0.0` for container access
- **Backend**: cargo-watch for auto-rebuild on file changes

**Benefits:**
- Eliminates CORS complexity in development
- Matches production environment architecture  
- Faster development cycle (no rebuilds)
- Easier onboarding for new developers
- Production-like SSL/routing behavior


# RULES
 - Use idomatic code for the appropriate language or framework.
 - Documentation should not include code that should go in actual implemented files.
 - Documentation should be succinct and clear
 - Documentation should maintain separation of concerns between documents so we are not repeating ourselves or creating possible documentation mismatching and confusion.
 - Code should prefer clarity over cleverness
 - When repeatedly encountering errors use context7 MCP to look up documentation to make sure you are correctly implementing code according to the packages intentions.
 - When encountering technical challenges (like UUIDv7 PostgreSQL extension), use web search tools to research solutions before suggesting alternatives or compromises. Many specific technical issues have existing solutions that can be found through targeted research.
 - ASK QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF ASSUMING: it is better to ask me than make an assumption. But also don't ask about every little detail. I know this is confusing but let's try to strike a balance. The more core the question is to the work the more likely you need to ask a question and not assume.
 - CHALLENGE BAD REQUESTS: If it seems like I (the user) am making a mistake. Challenge that mistake and make me defend the reasoning. If I override the objections then let it go.
- When a bash command fails because it has "No such file or directory" but you think that directory or file should exist. First check `pwd` to make sure you are where you think you are before you try anything else.
