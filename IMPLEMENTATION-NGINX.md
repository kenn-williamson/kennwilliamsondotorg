# Nginx Implementation

## Overview
Nginx reverse proxy implementation providing SSL termination, static file serving, and request routing between frontend and backend services in the development environment.

## Current Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Server**: Nginx (alpine Docker image)
- **SSL**: Self-signed certificates for development HTTPS
- **Configuration**: Volume-mounted config files
- **Environment**: Docker Compose integration

### Service Architecture
```
Development Environment (https://localhost)
    ↓
Nginx Reverse Proxy (Port 443)
    ├── Static files → Direct serving
    ├── /api/* → Backend (Rust:8080)
    ├── /_nuxt/* → Frontend assets (Nuxt.js:3000)
    └── /* → Frontend (Nuxt.js:3000)
```

### Docker Integration
- **nginx**: Main reverse proxy container in docker-compose.development.yml
- **Volumes**: Configuration files mounted from nginx/ directory
- **Self-signed SSL**: Development certificates for HTTPS testing
- **Port mapping**: 443:443 for HTTPS access

## Current Configuration

### Configuration Files
- `nginx/conf.d/default.conf` - Main site configuration with routing rules
- `nginx/nginx.conf` - Global nginx settings and performance tuning
- `nginx/ssl/` - Self-signed SSL certificates for development

### Routing Implementation
- **API Routes**: `/api/*` proxied to backend service on port 8080
- **Static Assets**: `/_nuxt/*` proxied to frontend for build assets
- **Frontend Routes**: All other routes proxied to frontend service on port 3000
- **WebSocket Support**: Configured for Nuxt.js Hot Module Replacement

### Development Features
- **HTTPS Development**: Self-signed certificates enable SSL testing locally
- **Hot Reload Support**: WebSocket proxy configuration for HMR
- **CORS Elimination**: Nginx proxy eliminates cross-origin issues
- **Request Logging**: Detailed access and error logging

## Current Environment Setup

### Development Environment
- **Access URL**: https://localhost (recommended)
- **HTTP Redirect**: Automatically redirects HTTP to HTTPS
- **SSL Certificates**: Self-signed for development use
- **Service Discovery**: Uses Docker Compose service names for upstream routing

### Docker Compose Configuration
Nginx service defined in docker-compose.development.yml:
- Depends on frontend and backend services
- Mounts configuration from nginx/ directory
- Exposes port 443 for HTTPS access
- Includes health check configuration

## Current Capabilities

### Request Handling
- **Reverse Proxy**: Routes requests to appropriate upstream services
- **SSL Termination**: Handles HTTPS encryption/decryption
- **Static File Serving**: Efficient delivery of static assets
- **Load Balancing**: Ready for multiple backend instances

### Development Workflow Integration
- **Hot Reload Support**: Works seamlessly with Nuxt.js HMR
- **Development Scripts**: Integrated with ./scripts/dev-start.sh and ./scripts/dev-logs.sh
- **Health Monitoring**: Compatible with ./scripts/health-check.sh

### Security Features
- **HTTPS Only**: All traffic served over HTTPS in development
- **Security Headers**: Basic security header configuration
- **Request Validation**: Input validation and request filtering

## Configuration Management

### Environment-Specific Configuration
- **Development**: Self-signed SSL, permissive CORS, detailed logging
- **Production**: Let's Encrypt SSL, security headers, optimized caching (planned)

### Maintenance and Updates
- **Configuration Updates**: Modify files in nginx/ directory
- **Service Restart**: Use development scripts for nginx service management
- **Log Access**: View nginx logs via ./scripts/dev-logs.sh nginx
