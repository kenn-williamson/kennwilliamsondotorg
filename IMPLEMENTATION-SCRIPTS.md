# Scripts Implementation

## Overview
Development automation scripts for workflow management, database operations, and Docker orchestration. Designed with single-responsibility principles and modular architecture.

## Script Architecture

### Design Philosophy
- **Individual scripts**: Single responsibility, focused tasks
- **Parameterized**: Scripts accept flags for different modes
- **Idempotent**: Safe to run multiple times
- **Error handling**: Fail fast with clear error messages
- **Development focused**: Optimized for daily development workflows

## Current Scripts

### Core Development Scripts
- **`dev-start.sh`**: Service management with flexible startup options
- **`dev-stop.sh`**: Clean service shutdown with removal options
- **`dev-logs.sh`**: Log viewing with filtering and formatting

### Database Management Scripts
- **`setup-db.sh`**: Safe database migration management (preserves data)
- **`prepare-sqlx.sh`**: SQLx query cache generation for Docker builds
- **`reset-db.sh`**: Complete database reset for development

### Health and Monitoring Scripts
- **`health-check.sh`**: Comprehensive service health verification

For detailed usage instructions, see [DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md](DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md).

## Implementation Features

### Service Management (`dev-start.sh`)
- Flexible service startup with build/restart options
- Service-specific targeting
- Build optimization with cache control
- Integrated logging options

### Database Operations
- **Migration Safety**: `setup-db.sh` preserves existing data
- **Environment Handling**: Auto-detects and loads appropriate configuration
- **Validation**: Schema verification and health checking
- **SQLx Integration**: Query cache management for Docker builds

### Health Monitoring (`health-check.sh`)
- PostgreSQL connectivity and database access verification
- Backend API endpoint validation  
- Resource usage monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Wait functionality for service startup scenarios

## Error Handling and Safety

### Common Safety Patterns
- Environment validation before execution
- Service connectivity verification
- Graceful failure with clear error messages
- Rollback capabilities where appropriate

### Logging and Debugging
- Colored output for status indication
- Comprehensive error reporting
- Progress indicators for long-running operations
- Debug mode options for troubleshooting

## Integration Points

### Docker Compose Integration
- Designed to work with both development and production compose files
- Service-specific targeting and management
- Resource monitoring and container health checking

### Development Environment
- Environment file detection and loading
- Database connectivity management
- Hot reload and development server integration

### CI/CD Preparation
Scripts designed with automation in mind for future CI/CD pipeline integration.
