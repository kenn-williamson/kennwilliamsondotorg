# Phrases System Feature Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of the "Motivational Phrases & User Management System" from ROADMAP.md - a dynamic phrase system to replace the hardcoded "Vigilance Maintained" with database-driven, user-customizable motivational phrases.

## Database Layer: ✅ COMPLETED

### Migration Strategy
**Approach**: Consolidated migration approach for clean production deployment
- **Development**: Had 6 individual migrations → Consolidated to 3 clean migrations
- **Production**: Will have 3 migrations from start (cleaner history)

### Applied Migrations
1. **`20250914134643_initial_schema`** - Consolidates original users, roles, incident_timers tables
2. **`20250914134654_add_refresh_tokens_and_user_active`** - Adds refresh token system + user.active field
3. **`20250914134703_add_phrases_system`** - Complete phrases system with initial data

### Database Schema
**New Tables Created:**
```sql
-- Main phrases storage
phrases (id, phrase_text, active, created_by, created_at, updated_at)
- 20 phrases inserted from Sayings.json
- System user created for attribution

-- Exclusion-based user preferences (stores what users DON'T want)
user_excluded_phrases (id, user_id, phrase_id, excluded_at)
- Default: Users see ALL phrases except excluded ones

-- User suggestion workflow
phrase_suggestions (id, user_id, phrase_text, status, admin_id, admin_reason, created_at, updated_at)
- Status: pending/approved/rejected
- Admin review workflow
```

### Validation Results
- ✅ All tables created successfully
- ✅ 20 phrases inserted from Sayings.json
- ✅ System user created (email: system@kennwilliamson.org)
- ✅ SQLx cache updated (14 queries) - Rust compilation ready
- ✅ Migration consolidation validated for production deployment

### Production Deployment Strategy
```bash
# On production server:
1. ./scripts/update-migrations-table.sh --prod --dry-run  # Verify SQL
2. ./scripts/update-migrations-table.sh --prod           # Consolidate existing migrations
3. sqlx migrate run                                       # Apply refresh tokens + phrases system
```

## Infrastructure Layer: ✅ COMPLETED

### Database Management Scripts
**Enhanced with environment auto-detection:**
- `backup-db.sh` - Container-aware backup/restore with auto-environment detection
- `download-backup.sh` - SSH key validation, local testing support
- `update-migrations-table.sh` - SQLx migration table consolidation
- `detect-environment.sh` - Shared environment detection with mismatch prompts

**Environment Detection Features:**
- Auto-detects development/production from running containers
- Helpful mismatch guidance: "💡 Tip: Use --dev flag for development containers"
- Y/N confirmation for intentional environment mismatches
- Consistent behavior across all multi-environment scripts

## Backend Implementation: ✅ COMPLETED (Simplified)

    pub created_at: DateTime<Utc>,
    pub updated_at: DateTime<Utc>,
}

// API Response models
pub struct PhraseResponse {
