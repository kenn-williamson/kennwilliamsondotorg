## Architecture Lessons Learned

### Successful Technical Decisions
- **Nuxt 4 Structure**: Using proper `app/` directory prevented component resolution issues
- **Service Layer**: Proper separation of concerns between stores and API calls  
- **Plugin Architecture**: Client-side initialization for auth state management
- **Development Scripts**: Comprehensive automation eliminates manual Docker commands
- **HMR Configuration**: WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol with nginx proxy for production-like development

### Key Technical Insights
- **Pinia Context**: Stores must be initialized after Pinia is ready
- **Asset Paths**: `~/assets/` for build-time processing, `/` for static serving
- **Composable Context**: Avoid calling composables from within store actions
- **VeeValidate Patterns**: Use `useForm` with `handleSubmit` for proper form handling
- **Directory Structure**: Following framework conventions prevents many issues
- **Container HMR**: Use same-origin requests through nginx proxy to eliminate CORS issues
- **SQLx**: Requires query cache for Docker builds (automated with scripts)
- **Environment Variables**: Docker Compose requires explicit `--env-file` for debug logging

### Problem Resolution Examples
- **CORS Issues**: Solved by implementing nginx reverse proxy for development
- **Pinia Context Errors**: Resolved by proper plugin initialization sequence
- **HMR WebSocket Failures**: Fixed by configuring WSS through nginx SSL termination
- **Asset Loading**: Corrected by following Nuxt 4 asset handling conventions
- **Form Validation Conflicts**: Resolved by using documented VeeValidate patterns

### Documentation Overhaul Phase
**Achievement**: Comprehensive documentation system with clear separation of concerns and standardized guidelines.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Documentation guidelines and standards established
- Clean separation between implementation docs and planning docs
- Lightweight CLAUDE.md as tool entry point
- Specialized workflow documentation (DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md, CODING-RULES.md)
- Complete testing implementation documentation
- Cross-referenced architecture and implementation docs
- Roadmap restructuring with proper prioritization
### Production Deployment Phase
**Achievement**: Successfully deployed to production at kennwilliamson.org with full SSL and production infrastructure.

**Key Deliverables**:
- AWS EC2 deployment with Docker Compose orchestration
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificate automation with renewal
- Nginx reverse proxy with production security headers

- Environment-specific configuration management
- Database backup and recovery procedures

### Critical Bug Fixes Phase
**Achievement**: Resolved post-deployment critical issues affecting user experience and timer functionality.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Fixed Timer State Sync Issue**: Timer updates/resets now immediately reflect in UI without page refresh
- **Fixed Page Focus Bug**: Timers now automatically restart with correct time when page regains focus after being hidden
- **Fixed Public Timer Privacy Issue**: Generic 404 response protects user privacy regardless of whether user exists or has timers
- **Corrected Latest Timer Logic**: Fixed `latestTimer` getter to use `reset_timestamp` instead of `created_at` for proper timer selection
- **Implemented Page Visibility Handling**: Added automatic timer restart on page visibility change and window focus events
- **Added Event Listener Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of global event listeners to prevent memory leaks

**Technical Implementation**:
- Page visibility API integration with automatic timer restart
- Rolling timer updates with proper state synchronization
- Global event listener management with cleanup lifecycle
- Privacy-first error messaging for public endpoints

### JWT Refresh Token System Implementation
**Achievement**: Complete implementation of secure rolling refresh token system with simplified architecture.

**Key Deliverables**:
- **Rolling Refresh Tokens**: 1-week expiration aligned with Nuxt session management for consistency
- **Simplified Architecture**: Pre-request token expiration checking (1-minute threshold) replacing complex dual-system approach
- **SHA-256 Token Security**: Refresh tokens hashed in database with automatic cleanup on user deletion
- **Multiple Device Support**: Separate refresh tokens per login session enabling concurrent device usage
- **Backend Token Management**: Complete CRUD operations with `/auth/refresh`, `/auth/revoke`, and `/auth/revoke-all` endpoints
- **Frontend JWT Manager**: Streamlined client-side token management with automatic refresh capability

**Technical Implementation**:
- Database migration for `refresh_tokens` table with proper foreign key constraints
- Backend service integration with secure token generation and validation
- Frontend composable architecture with pre-request token checking
- Session/refresh token expiration alignment (both 1-week) preventing orphaned tokens
