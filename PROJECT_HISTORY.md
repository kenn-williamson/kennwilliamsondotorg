# Project History

## Major Milestones

### Full-Stack Application Complete
**Achievement**: End-to-end functional web application with hot reload development environment.

### Foundation Phase
**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete Rust backend with Actix-web 4.x framework
- Nuxt.js 4.0.3 frontend with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- PostgreSQL 17 database with UUIDv7 support
- Docker Compose development environment
- JWT-based authentication system
- Incident timer CRUD functionality with public sharing
- Comprehensive integration test suite (11 tests)

### Frontend Integration Phase  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Responsive authentication pages with form validation
- Mobile-first design with gothic construction theme
- Pinia state management with proper SSR handling
- Service layer architecture for clean API separation
- Route protection middleware
- VeeValidate form validation system

### Development Tooling Phase
**Key Deliverables**:
- Automated development scripts (`dev-start.sh`, `dev-logs.sh`, etc.)
- Database migration and cache management tools

### Authentication & Session Management Fixes
**Key Deliverables**:
- **Fixed Authentication Redirect Flow**: Post-authentication redirect now working properly
- **Fixed Signin/Signup Redirect Failure**: Users now properly redirected back to intended page  
- **Fixed Double Redirect Issue**: Logged-in users no longer experience unnecessary redirects
- **Implemented Hybrid Auth Architecture**: JWT tokens with session-based refresh system
- **Resolved TypeScript Issues**: Proper type definitions for nuxt-auth-utils server-side usage
- **Docker Configuration Fixes**: Added shared directory mounting for proper type recognition
- Service health monitoring system
- Complete API contract documentation
- Hot Module Replacement with SSL development environment

## Architecture Lessons Learned

### Successful Technical Decisions
- **Nuxt 4 Structure**: Using proper `app/` directory prevented component resolution issues
- **Service Layer**: Proper separation of concerns between stores and API calls  
- **Plugin Architecture**: Client-side initialization for auth state management
- **Development Scripts**: Comprehensive automation eliminates manual Docker commands
- **HMR Configuration**: WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol with nginx proxy for production-like development

### Key Technical Insights
- **Pinia Context**: Stores must be initialized after Pinia is ready
- **Asset Paths**: `~/assets/` for build-time processing, `/` for static serving
- **Composable Context**: Avoid calling composables from within store actions
- **VeeValidate Patterns**: Use `useForm` with `handleSubmit` for proper form handling
- **Directory Structure**: Following framework conventions prevents many issues
- **Container HMR**: Use same-origin requests through nginx proxy to eliminate CORS issues
- **SQLx**: Requires query cache for Docker builds (automated with scripts)
- **Environment Variables**: Docker Compose requires explicit `--env-file` for debug logging

### Problem Resolution Examples
- **CORS Issues**: Solved by implementing nginx reverse proxy for development
- **Pinia Context Errors**: Resolved by proper plugin initialization sequence
- **HMR WebSocket Failures**: Fixed by configuring WSS through nginx SSL termination
- **Asset Loading**: Corrected by following Nuxt 4 asset handling conventions
- **Form Validation Conflicts**: Resolved by using documented VeeValidate patterns

### Documentation Overhaul Phase
**Achievement**: Comprehensive documentation system with clear separation of concerns and standardized guidelines.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Documentation guidelines and standards established
- Clean separation between implementation docs and planning docs
- Lightweight CLAUDE.md as tool entry point
- Specialized workflow documentation (DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md, CODING-RULES.md)
- Complete testing implementation documentation
- Cross-referenced architecture and implementation docs
- Roadmap restructuring with proper prioritization
### Production Deployment Phase
**Achievement**: Successfully deployed to production at kennwilliamson.org with full SSL and production infrastructure.

**Key Deliverables**:
- AWS EC2 deployment with Docker Compose orchestration
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificate automation with renewal
- Nginx reverse proxy with production security headers
- PostgreSQL persistence with automated backups
- Production environment configuration and secrets management
- Production-ready logging and error handling

**Technical Implementation**:
- SSL certificate management with automatic renewal scripts
- Production Docker Compose with proper service dependencies
- Environment-specific configuration management
- Database backup and recovery procedures

## Current Status
- **Application**: Live at kennwilliamson.org with full production infrastructure
- **Testing**: 11 comprehensive integration tests covering all API endpoints  
- **Development Environment**: Complete hot reload with production-like routing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation and workflow documentation
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with modern frameworks
- **Deployment**: Production deployment complete with SSL and monitoring
