# Project History

## Major Milestones

### Full-Stack Application Complete
**Achievement**: End-to-end functional web application with hot reload development environment.

### Foundation Phase
**Key Deliverables**:
- Complete Rust backend with Actix-web 4.x framework
- Nuxt.js 4.0.3 frontend with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- PostgreSQL 17 database with UUIDv7 support
- Docker Compose development environment
- JWT-based authentication system
- Incident timer CRUD functionality with public sharing
- Comprehensive integration test suite (11 tests)

### Frontend Integration Phase  
**Key Deliverables**:
- Responsive authentication pages with form validation
- Mobile-first design with gothic construction theme
- Pinia state management with proper SSR handling
- Service layer architecture for clean API separation
- Route protection middleware
- VeeValidate form validation system

### Development Tooling Phase
**Key Deliverables**:
- Automated development scripts (`dev-start.sh`, `dev-logs.sh`, etc.)
- Database migration and cache management tools
- Service health monitoring system
- Complete API contract documentation
- Hot Module Replacement with SSL development environment

## Architecture Lessons Learned

### Successful Technical Decisions
- **Nuxt 4 Structure**: Using proper `app/` directory prevented component resolution issues
- **Service Layer**: Proper separation of concerns between stores and API calls  
- **Plugin Architecture**: Client-side initialization for auth state management
- **Development Scripts**: Comprehensive automation eliminates manual Docker commands
- **HMR Configuration**: WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol with nginx proxy for production-like development

### Key Technical Insights
- **Pinia Context**: Stores must be initialized after Pinia is ready
- **Asset Paths**: `~/assets/` for build-time processing, `/` for static serving
- **Composable Context**: Avoid calling composables from within store actions
- **VeeValidate Patterns**: Use `useForm` with `handleSubmit` for proper form handling
- **Directory Structure**: Following framework conventions prevents many issues
- **Container HMR**: Use same-origin requests through nginx proxy to eliminate CORS issues
- **SQLx**: Requires query cache for Docker builds (automated with scripts)
- **Environment Variables**: Docker Compose requires explicit `--env-file` for debug logging

### Problem Resolution Examples
- **CORS Issues**: Solved by implementing nginx reverse proxy for development
- **Pinia Context Errors**: Resolved by proper plugin initialization sequence
- **HMR WebSocket Failures**: Fixed by configuring WSS through nginx SSL termination
- **Asset Loading**: Corrected by following Nuxt 4 asset handling conventions
- **Form Validation Conflicts**: Resolved by using documented VeeValidate patterns

## Current Status
- **Application**: Fully functional end-to-end web application
- **Testing**: 11 comprehensive integration tests covering all API endpoints  
- **Development Environment**: Hot reload capability with production-like routing
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive implementation and workflow documentation
- **Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns with modern frameworks
