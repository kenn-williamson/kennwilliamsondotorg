## Architecture Lessons Learned

### Successful Technical Decisions
- **Nuxt 4 Structure**: Using proper `app/` directory prevented component resolution issues
- **Service Layer**: Proper separation of concerns between stores and API calls  
- **Plugin Architecture**: Client-side initialization for auth state management
- **Development Scripts**: Comprehensive automation eliminates manual Docker commands
- **HMR Configuration**: WebSocket Secure (WSS) protocol with nginx proxy for production-like development

### Key Technical Insights
- **Pinia Context**: Stores must be initialized after Pinia is ready
- **Asset Paths**: `~/assets/` for build-time processing, `/` for static serving
- **Composable Context**: Avoid calling composables from within store actions
- **VeeValidate Patterns**: Use `useForm` with `handleSubmit` for proper form handling
- **Directory Structure**: Following framework conventions prevents many issues
- **Container HMR**: Use same-origin requests through nginx proxy to eliminate CORS issues
- **SQLx**: Requires query cache for Docker builds (automated with scripts)
- **Environment Variables**: Docker Compose requires explicit `--env-file` for debug logging

### Problem Resolution Examples
- **CORS Issues**: Solved by implementing nginx reverse proxy for development
- **Pinia Context Errors**: Resolved by proper plugin initialization sequence
- **HMR WebSocket Failures**: Fixed by configuring WSS through nginx SSL termination
- **Asset Loading**: Corrected by following Nuxt 4 asset handling conventions
