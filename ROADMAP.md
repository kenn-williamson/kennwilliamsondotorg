# KennWilliamson.org Roadmap

## Current Status
**Production deployment complete at kennwilliamson.org**. Full-stack application live with SSL, production infrastructure, and comprehensive development tooling. Complete admin panel system with user management, phrase moderation, 3-layer architecture refactor, comprehensive testing suite implemented with 200 total backend tests across all layers, and frontend architecture refactor complete with 25/25 components migrated to action composable + pure store pattern. Frontend testing infrastructure implemented with comprehensive test coverage for action composables, pure services, pure stores, and utilities with 175 tests achieving 100% success rate.

## Immediate Priorities

## Next Priorities

### Performance Optimization
**Priority**: Medium
**Goal**: Optimize application performance and user experience

**Current State**: Store architecture refactor complete with improved SSR hydration and smart fetch system
**Remaining Work**:
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement proper caching for both SSR and CSR data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics to measure SSR vs CSR performance impact

### Feature Expansion
**Goal**: Enhanced application functionality and user experience

**Content Management**:
- Blog/article system
- Portfolio project showcase
- Content creation and editing interface

**Advanced Timer Features**:
- Timer categories and tagging
- Historical data analysis
- Export functionality (CSV, JSON)
- Timer sharing and collaboration

**User Experience**:
- Advanced responsive design
- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Offline functionality
- Performance optimizations

## Future Architecture

### Authentication Enhancement  
**Goal**: Extended authentication options and improved security

**OAuth Integration**:
- Google OAuth 2.0 provider
- GitHub OAuth provider  
- Account linking for existing users (email as anchor point)
- Multi-provider authentication support

**Database Extensions**:
- OAuth provider tables
- Account linking relationships
- Enhanced user profile data

**Security Improvements**:
- Enhanced session management
- Account security settings
- Login history and monitoring
- Email integration for password reset notifications

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Automated testing and deployment
**Components**:
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Rollback capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability
**Goal**: Production-ready monitoring
**Components**:
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Log aggregation and search
- Uptime monitoring

### Scalability Improvements
**Goal**: Handle increased traffic and data
**Components**:
- Database read replicas
- Redis caching layer
- CDN integration
- Load balancing

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Security and DDoS Protection
**Status**: Deferred - requires investigation
**Issue**: Nginx rate limiting with `limit_req_zone` fails in Docker containers with "zero size shared memory zone" error
**Attempted Solutions**:
- Increased Docker memory limits (100MB â†’ 256MB)
- Explicit shared memory allocation (`shm_size: 128m`)
- Various zone size configurations
- Different zone naming strategies

**Next Steps**:
- Investigate alternative DDoS protection methods (Cloudflare, AWS WAF)
- Research nginx shared memory allocation in containerized environments
- Consider application-level rate limiting in Rust backend
- Evaluate third-party security services

### Code Quality
- End-to-end testing automation
- Code quality metrics and monitoring

### Performance Optimization
- Frontend bundle optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy implementation
- Image optimization and delivery

### Developer Experience
- Enhanced development tooling
- Automated code formatting and linting
- Git hooks for quality assurance
- Development environment improvements

## Decision Points

### Database Strategy
**Current**: PostgreSQL in Docker container
**Future Options**:
- AWS RDS for managed database
- Database clustering for high availability
- Read replicas for performance

**Decision Factors**: Cost, maintenance burden, performance requirements

### Authentication Strategy
**Current**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
**Future Enhancement**: OAuth integration
**Long-term**: Consider session-based auth for security

### Deployment Strategy
**Current**: Manual deployment planned
**Future**: Full CI/CD automation
**Considerations**: Blue-green vs rolling updates

## Success Metrics

### Admin User Management Phase
- User profile editing interface complete
- Admin user management dashboard functional
- Password reset system operational
- User promotion system functional

### Testing & Quality Phase
- CI/CD pipeline operational
- Performance monitoring in place

### Feature Expansion Phase
- Content management system
- Advanced timer features
- User engagement metrics
- PWA functionality

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database corruption**: Automated backup testing
- **SSL certificate expiry**: Automated renewal monitoring
- **Service outages**: Health checks and auto-restart
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular dependency updates

### Business Risks
- **Feature scope creep**: Prioritized roadmap discipline
- **Performance degradation**: Continuous monitoring
- **User experience issues**: Regular usability testing
