# KennWilliamson.org Roadmap

## Current Status
**Full-stack application with end-to-end functionality complete**. Core features implemented and working with comprehensive development tooling and hot reload environment.

## Features In Progress

### ðŸš§ Documentation Overhaul
**Status**: Active development
**Priority**: High
**Goal**: Comprehensive documentation review and standardization

**Scope**:
- Establish documentation guidelines and standards
- Separate current state from future planning
- Remove code duplication from documentation
- Implement cross-referencing system
- Create specialized documentation (workflow, testing, coding rules)

**Deliverables**:
- [DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md](DOCUMENTATION-GUIDELINES.md) âœ“
- ROADMAP.md (this document) âœ“
- Clean separation of implementation vs planning docs
- Lightweight [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) as tool entry point
- Specialized docs: CODING-RULES.md, DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md, IMPLEMENTATION-TESTING.md

## Next Priorities

### Production Deployment
**Goal**: Deploy the application to AWS EC2 with production-ready infrastructure

**Features**:
- AWS EC2 deployment automation
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificate setup
- Production Docker Compose configuration
- Database backup and recovery procedures
- Health monitoring and alerting

**Technical Requirements**:
- Nginx reverse proxy with SSL termination
- PostgreSQL data persistence strategy
- Service health checks and auto-restart
- Log aggregation and rotation

### Quality Assurance
**Goal**: Comprehensive testing coverage and code quality improvements

**Frontend Testing Implementation:**
- **Primary Framework**: Vitest (Vite-native, fast execution)
- **Component Testing**: Vue Test Utils for component isolation
- **E2E Testing**: Playwright for end-to-end workflows

**Test Categories:**
- **Unit Tests**: 
  - Composables (`useAuthService`, `useIncidentTimerService`, `useAuthFetch`)
  - Utilities (helper functions, formatters, validators)
  - Pinia stores (actions and state management)
- **Component Tests**: 
  - Authentication forms with validation testing
  - Navigation component with auth state handling
  - Timer components with CRUD operations and real-time display
  - Form validation (VeeValidate integration testing)
- **Integration Tests**: 
  - Complete authentication workflow (login/logout/registration)
  - End-to-end timer CRUD operations
  - Route protection (middleware-based authentication validation)

**Test Data Strategy:**
- Mock API responses for unit tests
- Test fixtures for consistent component testing
- Factory functions for generating test data
- Separate test environment configuration

**Test Setup:**
```bash
npm install --save-dev vitest @vue/test-utils jsdom
npm install --save-dev @vitest/ui # Optional test UI
```

**CI/CD Integration:**
- GitHub Actions automated test execution on pull requests
- Test coverage reporting and monitoring
- Performance monitoring and test execution time tracking
- Database migration testing in CI environment

**Coverage Goals:**
- Component coverage for all major components
- Store coverage for Pinia store actions and mutations
- Utility coverage for helper functions and composables
- Integration coverage for key user workflows

### Authentication Enhancement
**Goal**: Extended authentication options and improved security

**OAuth Integration**:
- Google OAuth 2.0 provider
- GitHub OAuth provider
- Account linking for existing users
- Multi-provider authentication support

**Database Extensions**:
- OAuth provider tables

- Progressive Web App (PWA) features
- Offline functionality
- Performance optimizations

## Future Architecture

### CI/CD Pipeline
**Goal**: Automated testing and deployment
**Components**:
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Automated testing (unit, integration, e2e)
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Rollback capabilities

### Monitoring and Observability
**Goal**: Production-ready monitoring
**Components**:
- Application performance monitoring
- Error tracking and alerting
- Log aggregation and search
- Uptime monitoring

### Scalability Improvements
**Goal**: Handle increased traffic and data
**Components**:
- Database read replicas
- Redis caching layer
- CDN integration
- Load balancing

## Technical Debt and Improvements

### Code Quality
- Comprehensive test coverage (currently backend only)
- Frontend unit and integration tests
- End-to-end testing automation
- Code quality metrics and monitoring

### Performance Optimization
- Frontend bundle optimization
- Database query optimization
- Caching strategy implementation
- Image optimization and delivery

### Developer Experience
- Enhanced development tooling

## Decision Points

### Database Strategy
**Current**: PostgreSQL in Docker container
**Future Options**:
- AWS RDS for managed database
- Database clustering for high availability
- Read replicas for performance

**Decision Factors**: Cost, maintenance burden, performance requirements

### Authentication Strategy
**Current**: JWT with bcrypt password hashing
**Future Enhancement**: OAuth integration
**Long-term**: Consider session-based auth for security

### Deployment Strategy
**Current**: Manual deployment planned
**Future**: Full CI/CD automation
**Considerations**: Blue-green vs rolling updates

## Success Metrics

### Phase 3 (Production)
- Site accessible at kennwilliamson.org with SSL
- 99.9% uptime target
