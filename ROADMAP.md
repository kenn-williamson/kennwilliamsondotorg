# KennWilliamson.org Roadmap

## Current Status
**Production deployment complete at kennwilliamson.org**. Full-stack application live with SSL, production infrastructure, and comprehensive development tooling. Complete admin panel system with user management, phrase moderation, 3-layer architecture refactor, comprehensive testing suite implemented with 200 total backend tests across all layers, and frontend architecture refactor complete with 25/25 components migrated to action composable + pure store pattern. Frontend testing infrastructure implemented with comprehensive test coverage for action composables, pure services, pure stores, and utilities with 175 tests achieving 100% success rate.

## Immediate Priorities

## Next Priorities

### OpenAPI Documentation (MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY)
**Priority**: Medium-High (Professional Polish)
