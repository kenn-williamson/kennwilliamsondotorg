# Life Now

*[Hero image: Recent photo with all three kids, or a candid family moment]*

This is where I am today: single dad to three remarkable kids, Enterprise Architect by day, disciple by calling, trying to figure out what it means to walk in love while managing the chaos of everyday life.

## The Kids: Three Very Different People

I have Rory (10), Charlie (9), and Teddy (almost 5). They're with me most of the time, about four and a half days a week. Their mom and I split custody, with me having marginally more time. We maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship, which I'm grateful for.

Each of my kids is completely unique, and I see different parts of myself and their family in each of them.

### Aurora Maeve (Rory)

Rory is my oldest at 10, and she's like the girl version of me in so many ways. I see myself in her constantly. The interesting thing is that I'm raising her totally differently than my mom raised me. My mom pushed me to excel constantly, which I hated growing up but which, looking back, helped me achieve a lot. With Rory, I'm taking the opposite approach: letting her grow at her own pace, providing a good example rather than didactic instruction, not pushing her to perform.

I don't know if this is the right approach. It's an experiment. But I want her to develop without the constant pressure I felt, while still hopefully giving her the tools she needs to succeed.

### Charlotte Anne (Charlie)

Charlie is 9 and is so much like my mom. She's an amazing social butterfly, loves everyone, is incredibly kind. She can also have a sharp wit when she wants to. Watching her navigate social situations with an ease I never had is both beautiful and bittersweet. She reminds me so much of my mom, and I'm grateful for that.

### Theodore Lysander (Teddy)

Teddy is almost 5 and has level three autism. He can't talk yet, which is obviously a significant challenge. I see so much of myself in him, but it's hard to get to know him because he's difficult to understand. Dealing with his disability has been a challenge for both of us.

We're doing therapy, working on equipping him with skills, hoping he'll be able to communicate more as he gets older. It's a journey, and honestly, I don't know where it's going to lead. But he's my son, and we're going to figure it out together.

## Daily Life: The Rhythms and Chaos

Every weekend is with my kids, and I love hanging out with them. The best weekends are when we have many activities and people to hang out with. I'm not the "sit down and play board games" dad. When we're home by ourselves, I tend to work on my website or other projects unless the kids need me. So having friends around and things for us to do together is ideal.

I'm not one of those parents who super-programs the weekend with constant activities, though. We're not doing baseball tournaments all weekend. I want good people for them to hang out with and things to keep them engaged. Balance.

### The Single Dad Reality

Being a single dad is hard in ways I didn't anticipate. The logistics alone are challenging: getting three kids to school, managing Teddy's therapy appointments, coordinating with their mom, handling the house, working full time. But the harder part is the isolation. Most of my friends are married with kids, and their lives are structured around their nuclear families. I'm not integrated into that in the same way.

I'm also terrible at reaching out to people. My pattern is to assume I'm a bother, fear rejection, and stay by myself. The people who stick around in my life are the ones willing to reach out to me and who understand that my default is isolation. I'm working on this, but it's slow progress.

## Church and Community

I'm at Church on the Move, which has been a good community for me. I'm involved in Bible study groups and small group ministries. I feel like I'm making some impact in encouraging and teaching newer believers, which is fulfilling.

I'm also involved in a homeschool co-op that my friend Mark's wife helped me get connected with. It's an Aspire group, and I'm volunteering there, which helps my kids get some of the educational experiences and social connections I think are valuable. The homeschooling community has been welcoming, and I'm trying to get more embedded in that world.

## Hobbies and Interests: The Nerdy Life

I've been a big nerd my whole life, and that hasn't changed. What has changed is what's practical with three kids.

### Former Gamer

I used to play many video games. Unfortunately, modern video games are not made for dads whose children need to interrupt them constantly. Everything is real-time now with no pause function. I couldn't make the "gamer dad" thing work without a partner helping manage the kids, which my friends who game have.

So I'm done with video games, much to the chagrin of my best friend from childhood who's a big gamer, and the game community I was involved with online. They're pretty annoyed with me, but that's the reality of being a dad.

### Anime and Manga

I enjoy anime. I used to read manga frequently, but I do so much reading for work and theology that I don't have bandwidth for it anymore. I usually wait for the anime adaptation. I've even come around to dubbed anime in my old age, though I used to prefer subtitles.

Some favorites: *Frieren: Beyond Journey's End*, *Legend of the Galactic Heroes*, *Cowboy Bebop*, *Berserk* (manga is better), *Vinland Saga*, *One Piece*, *Demon Slayer*. There are many more. Anime has been a constant throughout my life.

### Reading

I'm a voracious reader. Right now I'm reading:
- The Church Fathers (Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Athanasius, Ephrem)
- René Girard (currently working through *Violence and the Sacred*)
- The Bible (using daily reading plans, though not always consistently)

I used to read many sci-fi and fantasy novels. I've probably read over a thousand of them in my lifetime. *The Wheel of Time* (read it cover to cover maybe five or six times), *The Death Gate Cycle*, Raymond E. Feist's *Midkemia* series, Terry Pratchett's *Discworld*, Jim Butcher's *Dresden Files*. I loved literature and poetry too: Alexandre Dumas, Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Philip Larkin, the classics.

But these days, most of my reading energy goes to theology and philosophy. My ex-girlfriend Kathryn got me into literature and poetry that broadened my horizons from pure sci-fi/fantasy, and I'm grateful for that.

### Music: Guitar and Songwriting

I play guitar and write songs. My recent pattern is: I write the lyrics and the overall vision for the music, use AI to generate a version that gets close to what I'm hearing in my head, then practice it on guitar and perform it myself. So it's my lyrics and vision, written by AI, performed by me.

I've been drawn into the website project recently, so music has taken a back seat, but it's something I want to get back to.

### Fitness: The New Leaf

After military school, I didn't exercise at all except by accident. But recently I've turned a new leaf on fitness. I started hiking and have been enjoying it. I even hiked up and climbed to the top of a mountain recently, which was an interesting three-day experience and a genuine challenge given my fear of heights.

I've been keeping up with training for hiking: stairs training, walking with a pack, staying in hiking shape. My friend found a good deal on a home gym (like a Bowflex), and I've been thinking about getting into some weightlifting to add strength training to my cardio work.

I used to be a big swimmer. I was a lifeguard and swim instructor for five years and enjoyed it. But I haven't done much swimming recently because, as a single dad trying to practice purity, the pool is kind of a dangerous place for me.

## The Website Project

This personal website is a big passion project right now. I'm using it to learn technologies I haven't used professionally: Rust with Actix for the backend, Nuxt for the frontend, Postgres for the database with UUIDv7.

I love that I can work on this and pause whenever the kids need me. It's intellectually engaging, lets me stay sharp on emerging technologies, and gives me something to show for the time I spend on it. Plus, I'm using AI heavily in the development process, which lets me practice what I preach about AI augmentation.

I've learned a ton working on this project, especially about Postgres database design and optimization, which is different from the SQL Server work I usually do professionally.

## The Dating Question

I'm open about this: I'm looking for the right person to share life with. I'm also open about the fact that it's been hard.

I've tried dating apps. I've gone on blind dates. Nothing has stuck. Part of the problem is that I don't present well in a dating app format. All of my previous serious relationships developed organically from situations where I got to know someone in a non-dating context: friends, friends of friends, coworkers next door, someone at the pool where I was a lifeguard.

Dating apps require you to sell yourself immediately based on photos and a brief bio, and that's not my strength. I'm better in long-form conversation where my depth and intelligence and care for people can actually come through.

I'm picky, and I don't apologize for that. I've learned from past relationships that being with the wrong person is worse than being alone. I'm looking for someone who is Kingdom-oriented—her faith needs to be central, not peripheral. I need someone who's genuinely pursuing Christ and understands what that means. I want to build a traditional family with someone who embodies those values, not someone focused on climbing the corporate ladder. And I need genuine mutual attraction; I've learned that relationships work best when I'm reaching toward someone I deeply admire, someone who feels slightly out of my league. Without that dynamic, weird power imbalances develop.

That's a specific combination, and dating apps haven't been able to deliver it. So I'm giving it to God. I'm working on myself, trying to be the best Kingdom version of myself I can be, and trusting that if it's His will for me to find someone, He'll bring her into my life.

I have a medium-sized fear that I'm going to be alone for the rest of my life in a romantic sense. I'm coming to terms with it. It's hard, but it's better than being with the wrong person. I know that much from experience. At the same time, I hope. I'd love to have more children. I'd love to build a life with someone. I'd love to have a partner in this parenting journey. But if that's not in the cards, I'll trust that God has a different plan.

## Daily Struggles: The Ongoing Work

I want to be honest about where I struggle, because this isn't a highlight reel.

**Self-criticism**: I'm incredibly critical of myself in ways I'm not critical of others. I hold myself to much higher standards. I have so much empathy and sympathy for other people, but almost none for myself. I'm working on this.

**Patience**: This is a fruit of the Spirit I struggle with, especially in situations where roles aren't clear or people are acting ambiguously. When I'm in a clear teaching role, I do well. Otherwise, I get frustrated easily.

**Self-control**: Particularly with lust. I struggle with thinking about women in sexual ways, and not having a godly outlet for that makes it harder. Maybe that's a cop-out. I'm working on bringing this under control through discipline and prayer.

**Isolation**: My default is to withdraw and assume I'm a bother. Reaching out to people is hard. Maintaining relationships requires consistent effort that doesn't come naturally to me.

**Fear of rejection**: This underlies many of my social struggles. I don't want to suggest things to people and have them say no, even if they're busy. So I don't suggest things.

These are genuine struggles. I fail at walking in love constantly. But I keep trying, keep praying, keep trusting that God's grace is sufficient and that my weakness is where His strength is made perfect.

## What Makes Me Happy

Despite the struggles, there are things that bring me genuine happiness:

- When I solve a difficult problem at work that's been frustrating me
- When my kids do the right thing and make me proud
- When I clean the house and it looks nice
- When I feel like I've made a positive impact in someone's life, especially in my church community
- When people help me unexpectedly (like when my car battery died at church and multiple people came to help)
- Being able to buy a new car battery without worrying about money
- Quality time with friends, even if I'm terrible at initiating it
- Reading something that makes me see the world differently
- Creating something, whether it's code or music or teaching content

Happiness for me isn't about accumulating things. I'm not materialistic at all. My books are in totes in the garage because I'm too lazy to unpack them. I like having nice things that are beautiful and functional, but I don't collect or display.

Happiness is relationships, purpose, growth, and those small moments where life works.

These daily realities—the struggles and the small joys—are where faith and work meet life. They're also what shape my broader vision for what I'm building toward.
