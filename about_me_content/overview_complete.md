# About Kenn Williamson

## Present Tense

I'm a single dad to three remarkable kids: Rory (10), Charlie (9), and Teddy (almost 5). By day, I'm an Enterprise Architect at SEQTEK, building software systems and helping companies navigate the AI revolution with a healthy dose of realism. By calling, I'm a disciple of Christ trying to figure out what it means to walk in love, exploring theological territory that most people haven't heard of and many would find strange.

I live in Jenks, Oklahoma, where I'm juggling work deadlines, dance recitals, autism therapy appointments, homeschool co-op volunteering, and an ambitious personal website project that lets me geek out on Rust and modern web architecture. I read theology the way other people binge Netflix. I used to play many video games until real-time gaming and single parenthood proved incompatible. I'm learning to hike mountains despite a fear of heights, trying to stay patient when I want to be critical, and working on actually believing the grace I preach.

I'm also looking for the right person to share life with, though I've learned that "right" means Kingdom-oriented, traditionally-minded, and mutually attracted. It's a combination that dating apps haven't been able to deliver.

This is my story. It's not a resume and it's not a highlight reel. It's the real arc: gifted kid who couldn't function in school, lost years after my mother died, transformation through faith I didn't expect, and now trying to be a good father, a faithful disciple, and someone who actually helps people instead of thinking about it.

## The Arc

I was born in Tulsa in 1982 to a family that moved from lower-middle class to upper-middle class over the course of my childhood. My dad was a lawyer and state legislator; my mom was a teacher. I had four grandparents who were all formative influences. Engineers and entrepreneurs, both sets teaching me different things about work, money, and life.

On paper, I should have crushed it. High IQ, gifted programs, math competitions where I placed fourth in the state. In reality, I was the kid who could ace tests without studying but wouldn't turn in homework. The gap between my potential and my performance was a constant source of frustration for everyone, especially me. My parents divorced when I was ten. I got bullied. I changed schools five times. My senior year, my parents sent me to military school as a last-ditch intervention, and suddenly I got straight A's because I had no choice.

College was supposed to be the fresh start. Instead, it was a ten-year odyssey of false starts, major changes, and dropping out multiple times. I finally graduated with a mechanical engineering degree at 28, but not before working at a wastewater treatment plant where my boss told me I could have his job in ten years if I stuck with it. That was the clearest picture of a future I absolutely didn't want.

Then my mom got cancer. Watching her die while I was still figuring out my life sent me into a spiral I barely survived. I won't detail the specifics of that period. It involved substance abuse, self-destruction, and hurting people I cared about. What matters is that I hit bottom hard enough to realize I couldn't save myself.

I met my co-parent during that broken season. We had three kids together: Rory, Charlie, and Teddy. They are the best things that have ever happened to me, full stop. But the relationship with their mother was built on an unstable foundation. She's dealing with her own trauma and wasn't interested in the new direction my life was taking. We've been separated for over two and a half years and split custody, with me having marginally more time with the kids. Teddy has level three autism, which is its own journey.

The transformation didn't happen all at once. There was a hungover morning when I prayed, "Lord, can you save me again?" and slowly, things started to change. I found my way back to faith, but not the vanilla Midwestern Protestantism I grew up with. I started listening to Jordan Peterson, which led me to discover Jonathan Pageau and the symbolic way of reading Scripture. Through Pageau, I found my way to an Orthodox church and began reading the Church Fathers systematically: Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, Ephrem, Maximus the Confessor. Then I discovered René Girard's mimetic theory, which gave me language for patterns I'd already been seeing in Scripture. I found a reading of the Gospel that made sense of contradictions I'd struggled with my whole life. I'm now what you'd call a Tolstoyan Christian Anarchist, which sounds radical but means I think Jesus meant what he said about turning the other cheek and loving your enemies.

Professionally, I went back to school, finished my engineering degree, and then, after my engineering work proved unsatisfying, pivoted into software development through a coding boot camp in 2017. I've been at SEQTEK for almost seven and a half years now, moving from mid-level developer to Enterprise Architect. I've led successful projects, helped companies get acquired, and found my niche evangelizing what I call "AI realism." It's the middle path between "AI will do everything" and "AI is worthless."

Now I'm here: single dad, software architect, amateur theologian, trying to raise three kids to walk in love while figuring out what that means myself. I'm critical of myself in ways I'm not critical of others. I struggle with patience, with self-regulation, with the fear that I'm still getting it all wrong. But I'm also building something. Not simply software, but a life that has purpose beyond my own comfort.

## A Note on Tone

I'm usually pretty reserved about myself until someone asks. Then I'm open, maybe too open. This is the forum for that openness. You'll find vulnerability here, but not oversharing. Honesty about struggles, but not glorification of them. Self-criticism balanced with recognition of growth. And throughout it all, an attempt to point toward something bigger than myself—toward the Kingdom, toward love, toward truth.

If you're here because you're considering working with me professionally, you'll get a sense of how I think and what I value. If you're here because we might date, well, here's the whole picture. If you're here because you're curious about this Girard guy or what "non-sacrificial reading" means, I'll do my best to explain without assuming you have a theology degree.

Welcome to the story. It's still being written.
