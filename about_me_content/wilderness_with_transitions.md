# The Wilderness

*[Hero image: Something contemplative, maybe a photo from the wastewater plant era or early college]*

Military school had given me straight A's and a scholarship to the University of Missouri-Rolla, an engineering school. Everyone thought I'd finally figured it out. I hadn't.

## The College Odyssey: Ten Years to a Four-Year Degree

I graduated high school in 2000. I didn't get my bachelor's degree until 2010. That's the headline, but the path between those two points was a mess of false starts, dropped classes, changed majors, and fundamental misunderstandings about what I needed to succeed.

### Rolla: The Immediate Collapse

I went to University of Missouri-Rolla on a good scholarship, earned from that year of military school success. I majored in Metallurgical Engineering. Without the rigid structure I'd become accustomed to, I immediately fell apart and destroyed that opportunity.

I joined a fraternity hoping it would provide structure, but it was the wrong kind. At a predominantly male engineering school, fraternity life centered around drinking and partying. I got caught up in that world. The scholarship was gone. The opportunity was wasted. I came back home.

### The Major-Hopping Years at OSU

I enrolled at Oklahoma State University and began a cycle of changing majors, each time thinking I'd found the solution.

**Computer Science:** I started here and did well for a couple of semesters. I was good with object-oriented languages like Java. But I was already starting to lose momentum when we got to functional programming with languages like ML. That unfamiliar, unintuitive paradigm killed whatever momentum I had left, and I eventually abandoned it.

**Mathematics:** Maybe pure math would be better? It wasn't. I couldn't make it stick.

**Math Education:** I switched to this thinking it would require fewer upper-division math classes. Still couldn't make it work.

Eventually, I just left school entirely. I'd failed at this too.

## The Wake-Up Call: A Future I Didn't Want

After dropping out, I went to work for the city as an operator at the wastewater treatment plant. This job changed everything, though not in the way you might expect.

My boss was a guy named Larry, an older man with white hair and a big bushy white mustache who told stories flamboyantly. He didn't like me at first, but I won him over by letting him bum cigarettes and by just doing whatever he said, which made him look good. After I'd been there about two years, Larry told me I was good at the job and that if I kept at it, I could have his supervisor position in another five or ten years.

Hearing that was a pivotal moment. The job itself was incredibly boring. So much of the day was just sitting around, which I filled by playing Game Boy or reading. The work wasn't challenging. The future wasn't inspiring. When Larry laid out the option of grinding it out for another decade to get his job, I knew with absolute certainty that it was not the path for me.

That realization prompted me to go back to school while still working at the plant. I enrolled at Tulsa Community College to finish the specific prerequisites I needed for upper-division mechanical engineering classes. I already had my humanities and life science credits, so I focused on the hard science and engineering courses: Physics, Chemistry, Intro to Electrical Science, Thermodynamics I.

TCC had a "two-plus-two" program with OSU-Tulsa. After completing those prerequisites, I transferred to OSU-Tulsa and finally finished my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering. It had taken ten years, but I'd done it.

The wastewater plant taught me what I didn't want. Sometimes that's the most valuable lesson.

## When Everything Fell Apart

I graduated and started working for my professor, Dr. Morton, on his educational platform business called Expert TA. It was a platform for math, engineering, and physics education. Then I got what I thought was a "real job" as a mechanical engineer at Willbros, an oil and gas design company, designing compressor stations.

For a while, things actually seemed good. I had finished my degree after ten years of struggle. I had a career. I had a serious relationship with my girlfriend Kathryn, who was very beautiful and very smart. I'd rejected faith after watching the documentary Zeitgeist, embraced libertarianism and Austrian economics, and thought I'd figured out how the world worked without all that religious nonsense.

Looking back, it was superficial stability. I was functional but not whole. Kathryn and I wanted fundamentally different things from life. She didn't want kids; I did. She was comfortable with the substance-fueled edgy lifestyle we were living; I always gravitated toward something more traditional even when I was being edgy and drug-fueled myself. We were heading in different directions, though I couldn't see it clearly at the time.

Then everything came apart.

After about two years at Willbros, my mom got sick, and I wanted more flexibility to help care for her. I left and went back to working for Dr. Morton. He also connected me with Roy Farrell, who ran a company called HR Value creating spreadsheet automations for HR departments. I set up my own LLC and began contracting for both of them.

This should have been a stable period. Instead, it was the beginning of the darkest chapter of my life.

### Mom's Illness

My mom first got hurt when she flipped over her bike and broke a collarbone. She was out of commission, wasn't exercising, and got really depressed for about a year. When she started trying to recover, she immediately got a cancer diagnosis.

I was 27, 28, 29 years old, watching my mother die, and I could not handle it at all. I won't detail my behavior during this period because honestly, I'm ashamed of it. I was selfish. I was scared. I was angry. I made her final time harder instead of easier. That's something I'll carry with me.

When she died in December 2013, I was 31 years old, and whatever fragile stability I'd managed to build completely collapsed.

### The Lost Years

After my mom died, I spiraled into a period of self-destruction that nearly cost me everything. I won't catalog the specific substances or behaviors because that's not the point of this story. What matters is that I hit bottom. Hard.

I squandered the entire inheritance my mom left me. I destroyed relationships. I hurt people who cared about me. My business relationship with Roy fell apart. Professionally, I was adrift. Personally, I was a disaster. I even applied to be a supervisor back at the wastewater plant but didn't get a callback, which wasn't surprising given how I'd left.

There was a morning, hungover and in withdrawal, feeling absolutely terrible, when I prayed: "Lord, can you save me again? I can't keep doing this."

That prayer didn't immediately change everything. But it was the first crack in the wall I'd built around myself.

### Meeting My Co-Parent

During this broken season, I met the mother of my children. She had her own trauma and her own way of coping. When she met me, I was a mess, and I think I became a project for her.

We were never married, but we had three children together: Rory, Charlie, and Teddy. They are the best things that have ever happened to me, full stop. But the relationship with their mother was built on an unstable foundation.

She's dealing with her own trauma and wasn't interested in the new direction my life was taking. We've been separated for over two and a half years and split custody, with me having marginally more time with the kids. She's not a bad person. I don't wish her any ill will. I hope she finds peace.

## The Slow Climb Back

The transformation didn't happen all at once. There wasn't a single moment where everything changed. It was gradual, and honestly, it's still ongoing.

During those years with my co-parent, I was still partying heavily, still drinking too much, still trying to cope with substances. But slowly, things started to shift. I started saying yes to the Holy Spirit more often than I said no. I made mistakes, many of them, but the trajectory was changing.

Having kids gave me a purpose I'd been missing. I couldn't destroy myself anymore because I had these three little people depending on me. Rory, Charlie, and Teddy needed a father who was present, who was stable, who was trying.

I went back to church. I started reading. I discovered Jordan Peterson, which led me to Jonathan Pageau, which led me to Ren√© Girard and the Church Fathers. I found a reading of the Gospel that made sense of contradictions I'd struggled with. I found a faith that wasn't about control or guilt but about love and transformation.

The professional crisis that came from my falling out with Roy and my general instability forced me to make a choice: keep drifting, or commit to a new path. I chose the latter. I enrolled in a coding boot camp at Coding Dojo, worked harder than I'd worked at anything, and came out the other side with skills and a plan.

But none of that would have mattered if I hadn't first reached the point where I couldn't save myself. The wilderness period taught me that. I'm not strong enough, smart enough, or disciplined enough to pull myself up by my bootstraps. I needed something outside myself. I needed grace.

## What the Wilderness Taught Me

Looking back on those years, I can see now what I couldn't see then. The pain wasn't meaningless. The loss wasn't arbitrary. God was working even when I couldn't see it, even when I was actively running away.

My mom's death broke me open in ways that were necessary. The substance abuse and self-destruction showed me the limits of my own willpower. Meeting my co-parent and having my children gave me a reason to fight my way back. The professional failures cleared the path for a career pivot that has been more fulfilling than anything I could have planned.

I'm not glad I went through it. I wouldn't wish it on anyone. But I also can't deny that I'm a different person because of it. The wilderness stripped away everything I thought I was and left me with only what was real: my need for God, my love for my children, and a determination to stop hurting people.

That's a foundation you can build on. The way out of that darkness started with a hungover prayer I barely meant, and it would lead me to a faith I never expected.
