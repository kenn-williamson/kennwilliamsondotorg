    # RUSTSEC-2023-0071: RSA Marvin Attack vulnerability
    # Reason: This vulnerability is in the rsa crate, which is only used by sqlx-mysql.
    # Our project exclusively uses PostgreSQL (see Cargo.toml: features = ["postgres"]).
    # The MySQL feature is not enabled, so this dependency path exists in Cargo.lock
    # but is never compiled or used in our binary.
    "RUSTSEC-2023-0071",

    # RUSTSEC-2025-0111: tokio-tar PAX extended headers parsing vulnerability
    # Reason: This vulnerability is in tokio-tar, which is only used by testcontainers.
    # testcontainers is a dev-dependency used exclusively for integration tests.
    # It is never included in production builds and poses no risk to deployed code.
    "RUSTSEC-2025-0111",

    # RUSTSEC-2025-0134: rustls-pemfile is unmaintained
    # Reason: This crate is used by bollard -> testcontainers, which is a dev-dependency.
    # testcontainers is used exclusively for integration tests and is never included
    # in production builds. Waiting for upstream bollard to migrate to rustls-pki-types.
