    <p>
      This is where I am today: single dad to three remarkable kids, Enterprise
      Architect by day, disciple by calling, trying to figure out what it means to walk
      in love while managing the chaos of everyday life.
    </p>

    <h2>The Kids: Three Very Different People</h2>

    <p>
      I have Rory (10), Charlie (9), and Teddy (almost 5). They're with me most of the
      time, about four and a half days a week. Their mom and I split custody, with me
      having marginally more time. We maintain a healthy co-parenting relationship,
      which I'm grateful for.
    </p>

    <p>
      Each of my kids is completely unique, and I see different parts of myself and
      their family in each of them.
    </p>

    <h3>Aurora Maeve (Rory)</h3>

    <p>
      Rory is my oldest at 10, and she's like the girl version of me in so many ways. I
      see myself in her constantly. She has a tendency to ask lots of questions,
      especially precocious ones that can be a little uncomfortable for the person she's
      asking. She has no filter yet, no understanding of how a question might land. I
      was the same way at her age. She'll use a word perfectly in a sentence and then
      ask me what it means. When I explain that she just used it correctly, she'll say
      "But what does it mean specifically?" And then ask what "specifically" means.
    </p>

    <p>
      She's a little socially awkward, has a hard time making friends, and struggles
      with emotional regulation. Things can get blown out of proportion quickly. If I
      get on to her or raise my voice at all, she can shut down quickly, which
      makes correcting bad behavior challenging. She struggles with this with other
      children too. If she's challenged at all, she tends to shut down and try to
      isolate. It's hard.
    </p>

    <p>
      Rory spends hours in elaborate role-play, creating stories with her stuffies and
      dolls, playing text-based role-play chatbot adventures on her computer, watching
      her favorite YouTubers (she loves SPRUNKI), and playing Avatar World. She and
      Charlie spend a lot of time making up dances and choreography together. She enjoys
      going to the park as well.
    </p>

    <p>
      She's naturally good at figuring things out: puzzles, schoolwork (though I don't
      push her hard on it), making surprisingly insightful connections. But she's pretty
      selective about friends and genuinely struggles to make them, which worries me as
      she gets older.
    </p>

    <p>
      With her siblings, she's protective, annoyed, and loving. She and Charlie are what
      we call "best frenemies." They're together all the time, and it's very clear she
      loves them. She dotes on Teddy, almost to the point where she's way up in his
      business, but it's great.
    </p>

    <p>
      She's entering a more self-aware phase now, starting to talk about boys and asking
      questions about how the world works, checking if her understanding is correct,
      seeking clarification. I can see her growing up in these moments, and I am not
      ready for pre-teens or teenage girls.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm raising her very differently than my mom raised me. When I was a kid, I was
      pushed to succeed heavily: soccer, baseball, piano, church programs, tons of
      activities, strong emphasis on academic achievement. With Rory, I'm taking a
      different approach. I have her in dance because I wanted one physical activity for
      motor skills, but beyond that, I let her explore her own interests. She goes
      deeper that way, into her role-play, into the choreography she creates with her
      sister.
    </p>

    <p>
      I want her to develop without the constant pressure I felt, while still giving her
      the tools she needs to succeed. I fear that adolescence will be difficult for a
      curious, earnest, sweet child like my daughter. I hope she doesn't get hurt too
      badly by other kids. But that's part of growing up.
    </p>

    <p>
      She's very interested in justice and fairness, in being kind, in things making
      sense and being consistent. I see her becoming someone with a curious and
      scientific mind—maybe going into a medical field or research. But she also talks a
      lot about wanting to get married and have kids, so maybe she'll want to be a
      homemaker. Ultimately, whatever is fulfilling and whatever is God's plan for her
      life, that's what I want. I'm trying not to plan too heavily on it.
    </p>

    <h3>Charlotte Ann (Charlie)</h3>

    <p>
      Charlie is 9 and is so much like my mom. I'm not a social butterfly, so it's a
      little hard for me to fully understand how she does it, but she seems to make
      friends everywhere she goes easily. She's very friendly, very good about
      greeting people. Strangers, people she doesn't know. Just very emotionally
      adept and socially adept. At our homeschool co-op, we've been there maybe three
      times, and she already has two best friends. It's crazy how quickly she makes
      friends like that.
    </p>

    <p>
      She captures my mom's essence of being friendly, having a lot of love for
      people, and being deeply invested in relationships. My mom would get pretty upset
      when things were going poorly for her friends, or if she was having problems with a
      friend or relationship. She took it very hard. Charlie does too. She's very good
      at sharing, very good at including people (except her sister sometimes, but
      they're together all the time). She just wants to make sure everybody's taken care
      of. And she has a sharp wit, playful and clever with plays on words, using her
      bigger-for-her-age vocabulary to make funny comments. She likes to be sassy, to
      show a little attitude, but in a nice way, never mean.
    </p>

    <p>
      She's thriving in her activities: dance class, the drama program at co-op, being in
      The Nutcracker (and already eager for the spring musical). Board games, especially
      Uno, and art projects fill her time at home. Her social awareness is above average,
      and her reading and math skills are strong too.
    </p>

    <p>
      She needs support when people are being mean. She doesn't take that very well. She
      needs encouragement to stay with things sometimes because she can be a little bit
      distracted. Even in dance, as much as she loves it, she's still only nine and
      doesn't have the drive of a serious dancer.
    </p>

    <p>
      With her siblings, she's a caretaker for Teddy, loving to take care of him. As I
      mentioned with Rory, Rory and Charlie are best frenemies, together all the time,
      loving each other, playing games, getting mad at each other, fighting. It's amazing
      to watch.
    </p>

    <p>
      Charlie can be a little bit dramatic and expressive when it comes to big emotions.
      She's not quite as explosive as Rory can be, but she's much more of a start-crying
      type rather than getting mad and losing her temper like Rory does.
    </p>

    <p>
      Seeing my mom in Charlie brings comfort. My mom's spirit is being carried on in my
      children. Like my mom, Charlie feels relationships deeply and takes hurt to heart.
      My mom often talked about how her own mother minimized feelings with a "nobody
      likes a sourpuss" attitude, which was hard for someone who took relationships so
      seriously. I'm trying to give Charlie what my mom needed: acknowledgment that it's
      okay to be upset, that feelings matter, that you communicate through them rather
      than stuff them down.
    </p>

    <p>
      Watching her navigate social situations with an ease I never had is beautiful. I
      hope she can fulfill God's purpose for her life by continuing to connect with
      people. As she enters her preteen and teenage years, kids can be cruel, and she'll
      have to learn how to protect her tender heart without closing it off.
    </p>

    <h3>Theodore Lysander (Teddy)</h3>

    <p>
      Teddy is almost 5 and has

      >. He can't talk yet, which is a significant challenge. How he communicates: he
      comes up and taps me on the shoulder, and that means "come and follow me to where
      I'm going." Then he looks at me and I'm supposed to understand what it is. For me,
      the breakthrough is in my ability to maintain composure despite frustration because
      he doesn't know any better and he's trying his best, and it's frustrating
      for him too.
    </p>

    <p>
      I see so much of myself in him. That same curiosity and intelligence, the way he
      figures things out even when he can't communicate them. When I was young, I made
      friends with adults much more readily than children, and Teddy is the same. All of
      his caregivers and the adults around him love and care about him deeply. Up at
      church, there are high school and middle school helpers in the kids' Sunday
      school, people I don't even know who know Teddy and say hi to him. I've struggled
      all my life to communicate my feelings and felt misunderstood often. For Teddy,
      that's in overdrive.
    </p>

    <p>
      He's in ABA therapy and speech and occupational therapy. I worry a little bit
      because I'm not there with him and he can't tell me if anything's going wrong. But
      luckily, we have good therapists that I trust. The progress is slow, but
      it's steady. One thing is that he will kind of stay close to you and follow you
      when you ask him and doesn't run off as much, which is nice.
    </p>

    <p>
      Swinging is his favorite thing in the world. We're lucky there's a park right
      across from therapy to use as a reward. Give him his tablet, a movie, and his
      preferred foods, and he's content. He loves playing peekaboo with that mischievous
      giggle of his, though he hates trying new foods and being told no.
    </p>

    <p>
      The hardest part of caring for Teddy day-to-day is the constant vigilance. Leave
      something out he can get into, and he will. At the end of the day when I'm
      frazzled, I'll make a mistake, like leaving out a mostly-full Gatorade powder
      canister. He dumped it all over his bed, his room, himself. He was eating it, so it
      was wet and sticky everywhere. These moments wear on you.
    </p>

    <p>
      His autism-related behaviors are quintessential level three. He stims by
      biting his hand, which is terrible. He doesn't bite it hard enough to break the
      skin very much, but he chaps the skin on his hand, on the fleshy part under his
      thumb. He will get pretty upset when things are not in routine. For instance, when
      I pick him up from his mom's, there was this one time we had to go back to her
      house because the girls had forgotten something. And he got like, "No, Dad, after
      you pick me up from Mom's, we go to your house and I get my snacks and my tablet
      and my movies. That's what we were doing, not coming back here." He got pretty
      riled up. And he tunnels hard on things. Once he gets it in his mind that
      he's going to get something or do something, unless you can make it disappear (out
      of sight, out of mind), then it's going to be challenging to redirect him.
    </p>

    <p>
      When he can't communicate and gets frustrated, he can get pretty upset with it.
      I'm kind of following the advice of the therapist, which is to ignore it. Don't
      engage (positive or negative, comfort or discipline) on it, because ultimately
      that seems to be the only way to teach him that it's not worthwhile to have the
      meltdown. I don't know what happens for other people, but I kind of have an
      unspoken communication with him and I have an idea about what he wants in many
      cases. Don't ask me how I know, I just kind of read the situation, I guess. Like,
      he's brought me into his room and he has all his snacks and he's looking at the
      TV, and I'm like, "Oh, you want a different movie. You don't like this movie."
    </p>

    <p>
      Rory and Charlie are patient, protective, and understanding with Teddy. They're
      very good sisters who love him deeply.
    </p>

    <p>
      As Teddy's dad, I navigate grief and hope in equal measure. I grieve for uncertain
      potential, wrestle with frustration and guilt, wonder what I could have done
      differently. My hope is that he can have a somewhat independent life, that he can
      find purpose and meaning, maybe love. My fear is that he'll be trapped in
      frustration and isolation, feeling misunderstood. I think about his identity, how
      much is wrapped up in autism versus just being Teddy. It's both. Autism is
      something you are, not something you have. But it's just a part of who he is. He's
      also a charismatic young man who draws people in, handsome and engaging in ways I
      can't fully explain. We're doing therapy, equipping him with skills, hoping he'll
      be able to communicate more as he gets older. It's a journey, and I don't know
      where it leads. But he's my son, and I love him. We're going to figure it out
      together.

    <h2>Daily Life: The Rhythms and Chaos</h2>

    <p>
      Every weekend is with my kids, and I love hanging out with them. The best weekends
      are when we have many activities and people to hang out with. I'm not the "sit
      down and play board games" dad. When we're home by ourselves, I tend to work on my
      website or other projects unless the kids need me. So having friends around and
      things for us to do together is ideal.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not one of those parents who super-programs the weekend with constant
      activities, though. We're not doing baseball tournaments all weekend. I want good
      people for them to hang out with and things to keep them engaged. Balance.
    </p>

    <h3>The Single Dad Reality</h3>

    <p>
      Being a single dad is hard in ways I didn't anticipate. The logistics alone are
      challenging: getting three kids to school, managing Teddy's therapy appointments,
      coordinating with their mom, handling the house, working full time. But the harder
      part is the isolation. Most of my friends are married with kids, and their lives
      are structured around their nuclear families. I'm not integrated into that in the
      same way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also terrible at reaching out to people. My pattern is to assume I'm a bother,
      fear rejection, and stay by myself. The people who stick around in my life are the
      ones willing to reach out to me and who understand that my default is isolation.
      I'm working on this, but it's slow progress.
    </p>

    <h2>Church and Community</h2>

    <p>
      I'm at Church on the Move, which has been a good community for me. I'm involved in
      Bible study groups and small group ministries. I feel like I'm making some impact
      in encouraging and teaching newer believers, which is fulfilling.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm also involved in a homeschool co-op that my friend Mark's wife helped me get
      connected with. It's an Aspire group, and I'm volunteering there, which helps my
      kids get some of the educational experiences and social connections I think are
      valuable. The homeschooling community has been welcoming, and I'm trying to get
      more embedded in that world.
    </p>

    />

    <h2>Hobbies and Interests: The Nerdy Life</h2>

    <p>
      I've been a big nerd my whole life, and that hasn't changed. What has changed is
      what's practical with three kids.
    </p>

    <h3>Former Gamer</h3>

    <p>
      I used to play many video games. Unfortunately, modern video games are not made
      for dads whose children need to interrupt them constantly. Everything is real-time
      now with no pause function. I couldn't make the "gamer dad" thing work without a
      partner helping manage the kids, which my friends who game have.
    </p>

    <p>
      So I'm done with video games, much to the chagrin of my best friend from childhood
      who's a big gamer, and the game community I was involved with online. They're
      pretty annoyed with me, but that's the reality of being a dad.
    </p>

    <h3>Anime and Manga</h3>

    <p>
      I enjoy anime. I used to read manga frequently, but I do so much reading for work
      and theology that I don't have bandwidth for it anymore. I usually wait for the
      anime adaptation. I've even come around to dubbed anime in my old age, though I
      used to prefer subtitles.
    </p>

    <p>
      Some favorites: <em>Frieren: Beyond Journey's End</em>,
      <em>Legend of the Galactic Heroes</em>, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>,
      <em>Berserk</em> (manga is better), <em>Vinland Saga</em>, <em>One Piece</em>,
      <em>Demon Slayer</em>. There are many more. Anime has been a constant throughout
      my life.
    </p>

    <h3>Reading</h3>

    <p>I'm a voracious reader. Right now I'm reading:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>The Church Fathers (Gregory of Nyssa, Maximus, Athanasius, Ephrem)</li>
      <li>René Girard (currently working through <em>Violence and the Sacred</em>)</li>
      <li>The Bible (using daily reading plans, though not always consistently)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      I used to read many sci-fi and fantasy novels. I've probably read over a thousand
      of them in my lifetime. <em>The Wheel of Time</em> (read it cover to cover maybe
      five or six times), <em>The Death Gate Cycle</em>, Raymond E. Feist's
      <em>Midkemia</em> series, Terry Pratchett's <em>Discworld</em>, Jim Butcher's
      <em>Dresden Files</em>. I loved literature and poetry too: Alexandre Dumas,
      Shakespeare, Oscar Wilde, Philip Larkin, the classics.
    </p>

    <p>
      But these days, most of my reading energy goes to theology and philosophy. My
      ex-girlfriend Kathryn got me into literature and poetry that broadened my horizons
      from pure sci-fi/fantasy, and I'm grateful for that.
    </p>

    <h3>Music: Guitar and Songwriting</h3>

    <p>
      I play guitar and write songs. My recent pattern is: I write the lyrics and the
      overall vision for the music, use a generative model to create a version that gets close to what
      I'm hearing in my head, then practice it on guitar and perform it myself. So it's
      my lyrics and vision, music written by a generative model, performed by me.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been drawn into the website project recently, so music has taken a back seat,
      but it's something I will continue to do as I get more free time.
    </p>

    <h3>Fitness: The New Leaf</h3>

    <p>
      After military school, I didn't exercise at all except by accident. But recently
      I've turned a new leaf on fitness. I started hiking and have been enjoying it. I
      even hiked up and climbed to the top of a mountain recently, which was an
      interesting three-day experience and a genuine challenge given my fear of heights.
    </p>

    <p>
      I've been keeping up with training for hiking: stairs training, walking with a
      pack, staying in hiking shape. My friend found a good deal on a home gym (like a
      Bowflex), and I've been thinking about getting into some weightlifting to add
      strength training to my cardio work.
    </p>

    <p>
      I used to be a big swimmer. I was a lifeguard and swim instructor for five years
      and enjoyed it. But I haven't done much swimming recently because, as a single dad
      trying to practice purity, the pool is kind of a dangerous place for me.

      I love that I can work on this and pause whenever the kids need me. It's
      intellectually engaging, lets me stay sharp on emerging technologies, and gives me
      something to show for the time I spend on it. Plus, I'm using generative models heavily in the
      development process, which lets me practice what I preach about Intelligence Augmentation.

      I've learned a ton working on this project, especially about Postgres database
      design and optimization, which is different from the SQL Server work I usually do
      professionally.

    <h2>The Dating Question</h2>

    <p>
      I'm open about this: I'd love to find the right person to share life with. I'm a
      romantic at heart. I'm the guy who handmade a Halloween costume of a juice box with
      Betty Boop on it (we called it "Boop Juice"), who's crafted throw pillows and
      jewelry boxes, who stops at the store to pick up something just because I know
      she'd like it. I'm considerate. I think about how my actions affect my partner. I
      keep her on my mind: calling before making plans with friends, remembering the
      little things, doing sweet things for birthdays and anniversaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Physical affection is important to me. I imagine cuddling on the couch reading or
      watching anime together, waking up before she does just to watch her sleep for a
      moment, cooking dinner side by side, having someone there when I get home. I want
      the everyday partnership: cleaning up the house together, working through
      frustrations with good communication and making up, having my bathroom cluttered
      with her makeup and curlers, downsizing my sprawling closet to one tiny rack so the
      rest can be hers. I want her to decorate the house because my walls are bare and I
      have no desire to pick out décor, but I'd love to live in a home that feels warm
      and beautiful because she made it that way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I do better with organic connection than dating apps. All of my previous serious
      relationships developed naturally: friends, friends of friends, coworkers, someone
      at the pool where I was a lifeguard. Dating apps require you to sell yourself
      immediately based on photos and a brief bio, and that's not my strength. I'm better
      in long-form conversation where depth and care for people can actually come
      through. Coffee at a local shop, walking through Philbrook Museum, dinner and a
      stroll along the Riverwalk. These are where I connect with people.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here's what I'm looking for: someone who's Kingdom-oriented, where faith is central
      rather than peripheral. Someone bubbly, vivacious, outgoing, the kind of person
      who's a natural connector, who can draw me out of my introverted default without
      getting frustrated when there's resistance. I need loyalty, sincerity, earnestness,
      someone hardworking who embodies traditional family values rather than focusing on
      climbing the corporate ladder. I want to build something together.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm attracted to women who take care of themselves and carry themselves with
      confidence. Physical chemistry matters, and I know it when I feel it. I've learned
      from past relationships that genuine mutual attraction is important. When there's
      real chemistry and admiration, everything else works better.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm picky, and I don't apologize for that. I've learned that being with the wrong
      person is worse than being alone. So I'm working on being the best version of
      myself I can be: growing in patience, fighting my tendency to isolate, learning to
      reach out to people despite my fear of rejection. I'm trusting that if it's God's
      will for me to find someone, He'll bring her into my life in His timing.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope that happens. I'd love to have more children. I'd love to build a life with
      someone and have a partner in this parenting journey. But I'm holding it with open
      hands. I'm focused on being faithful with what's in front of me and loving the
      people around me well. The rest is in God's hands.
    </p>

    <h2>Daily Struggles: The Ongoing Work</h2>

    <p>
      I want to be honest about where I struggle, because this isn't a highlight reel.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Self-criticism</strong>: I'm incredibly critical of myself in ways I'm not
      critical of others. I hold myself to much higher standards. I have so much empathy
      and sympathy for other people, but almost none for myself. I'm working on this.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Patience</strong>: This is a fruit of the Spirit I struggle with,
      especially in situations where roles aren't clear or people are acting
      ambiguously. When I'm in a clear teaching role, I do well. Otherwise, I get
      frustrated easily.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Self-control</strong>: Particularly with lust. I struggle with thinking
      about women in sexual ways, and not having a godly outlet for that makes it
      harder. Maybe that's a cop-out. I'm working on bringing this under control through
      discipline and prayer.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Isolation</strong>: My default is to withdraw and assume I'm a bother.
      Reaching out to people is hard. Maintaining relationships requires consistent
      effort that doesn't come naturally to me.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Fear of rejection</strong>: This underlies many of my social struggles. I
      don't want to suggest things to people and have them say no, even if they're busy.
      So I don't suggest things.
    </p>

    <p>
      These are genuine struggles. I fail at walking in love constantly. But I keep
      trying, keep praying, keep trusting that God's grace is sufficient and that my
      weakness is where His strength is made perfect.
    </p>

    <h2>What Makes Me Happy</h2>

    <p>Despite the struggles, there are things that bring me genuine happiness:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>When I solve a difficult problem at work that's been frustrating me</li>
      <li>When my kids do the right thing and make me proud</li>
      <li>When I clean the house and it looks nice</li>
      <li>
        When I feel like I've made a positive impact in someone's life, especially in my
        church community
      </li>
      <li>
        When people help me unexpectedly (like when my car battery died at church and
        multiple people came to help)
      </li>
      <li>Being able to buy a new car battery without worrying about money</li>
      <li>Quality time with friends, even if I'm terrible at initiating it</li>
      <li>Reading something that makes me see the world differently</li>
      <li>Creating something, whether it's code or music or teaching content</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Happiness for me isn't about accumulating things. I'm not materialistic at all. My
      books are in totes in the garage because I'm too lazy to unpack them. I like
      having nice things that are beautiful and functional, but I don't collect or
      display.
    </p>

    <p>
      Happiness is relationships, purpose, growth, and those small moments where life
      works.
    </p>

    <p>
      These daily realities (the struggles and the small joys) are where faith and work
      meet life. They're also what shape my broader vision for what I'm building toward.
