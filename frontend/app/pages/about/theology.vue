      This section explains the theological framework that emerged from my reading
      journey. If you're here from the Finding Faith section, you know how I arrived at
      these ideas. Now let me explain what they actually are and why they matter.

    <h2>The Foundation: What I Learned from the Church Fathers</h2>

    <p>
      After reading through the Bible in one year, I worked systematically through
      several Church Fathers. Each one contributed something essential to my
      understanding.

          Saint Athanasius the Great (c. 297-373) was Archbishop of Alexandria and a pillar of Orthodoxy. He defended the Nicene faith against Arianism and wrote extensively on the Incarnation and theosis.

      Athanasius, particularly in <em>On the Incarnation</em>, introduced me to the
      concept of

        text="Theosis (meaning 'deification' or 'divinization') is a transformative process in Eastern Orthodox theology whose aim is likeness to or union with God. It's the process of being united with God's energies (not essence), beginning in this life and consummated in bodily resurrection. As St. Athanasius wrote: 'The Son of God became man, that we might become god.'"

      literally becoming divine. It's about participating in God's nature, being
      transformed into His likeness. The Incarnation isn't just about fixing a legal
      problem (satisfying divine justice). It's about God entering into creation to
      transform it from within.

          Saint Gregory of Nyssa (c. 335-395) was a Cappadocian Father, brother of Saint Basil the Great, and one of the most profound Christian thinkers of the fourth century. He taught about universal reconciliation and spiritual transformation.

      />
      Gregory's understanding of universal reconciliation and the transformation of
      desire resonated deeply. He saw salvation not as escape from punishment but as
      healing and restoration. Sin isn't primarily about breaking rules; it's about
      disordered desires that lead us away from what's actually good for us. Salvation
      is God reordering those desires, healing us into wholeness.

          Saint Ephrem the Syrian (c. 306-373) was an Aramean theologian, hymnographer, and teacher of repentance. Known for his poetic hymns and symbolic theology, he is one of the most notable Church Fathers of Eastern Christianity.

      Ephrem brought a poetic, symbolic approach to theology. He understood that
      biblical language works through imagery and types, not just propositional
      statements. Scripture reveals truth through patterns, metaphors, and recurring
      symbols. You can't just extract doctrines like mining data. You have to see how the
      whole thing fits together as a coherent vision.

          Saint Maximus the Confessor (c. 580-662) was a Christian monk, theologian, and scholar. He was persecuted for his Christological positions, had his tongue and right hand mutilated, and died in exile. He developed a profound cosmic theology of Christ's redemption of all creation.

      Maximus completed this foundation with his cosmic theology. Christ doesn't just
      save individual souls; He recapitulates all of creation, bringing everything back
      into right relationship with God. The Incarnation has cosmic implications. God
      isn't extracting believers from a doomed world. He's redeeming the world itself.

      These Fathers showed me that early Christianity had a much richer, more holistic
      understanding of salvation than I'd been taught. They were working with categories
      that made sense of things I'd been struggling with.

    <h2 class="clear-both">Discovering René Girard: The Framework That Connected Everything</h2>

      After the Church Fathers, I encountered René Girard's work, and suddenly
      everything clicked into place. Girard didn't give me my understanding. He gave me
      the language and systematic framework for what I'd already been discovering
      through Scripture and the Fathers.

    <h3>What Is Mimetic Theory?</h3>

    <p>
      <strong>The core insight:</strong> Human desire is imitative (mimetic). We don't
      want things because they're inherently desirable to us. We want things because we
      see other people wanting them.
    </p>

    <p>
      A man sees his neighbor with a beautiful watch, suddenly he wants that watch. A
      child ignores a toy until another child picks it up, then suddenly it's the most
      important toy in the world. We learn what to desire by copying the desires of
      people around us.
    </p>

    <p>
      This leads to rivalry. If we're all imitating each other's desires, we end up
      wanting the same things, which means we end up competing for the same things.
      Competition breeds conflict.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The scapegoat mechanism:</strong> When mimetic rivalry threatens to tear a
      community apart in all-against-all violence, societies have historically resolved
      the crisis through
      <SteampunkTooltip
        text="The scapegoat mechanism is society's method for dissipating tensions by redirecting violence to an outsider. When mimetic rivalry threatens the community, all participants spontaneously unite in violence against a single victim. This sacrifice (through death or expulsion) releases interpersonal tensions and restores social order. For it to work, participants must genuinely believe the victim is guilty—they cannot recognize it as scapegoating."
        placement="top"
      >
        <span>scapegoating</span> </SteampunkTooltip
      >. The community unites by projecting all their conflict onto a single victim.
      Former enemies become friends as they collectively participate in violence against
      a chosen scapegoat.
    </p>

    <p>
      This mechanism, repeated throughout human history, becomes ritualized as
      sacrifice. Ancient religions are built on this pattern: restore peace through the
      sacrifice of a victim. It works, temporarily, but it's based on a lie. The victim
      is innocent, chosen arbitrarily, but treated as if they're guilty and deserving of
      violence.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>The revelation:</strong> The Judeo-Christian scriptures, and especially
      the Gospels, expose this mechanism. Unlike every other ancient text that tells the
      story from the perspective of the mob, the Bible tells it from the perspective of
      the victim.

    <h2>The Non-Sacrificial Reading of the Gospel</h2>

    <p>This is the key insight that changed everything for me.</p>

    <p>
      Traditional Christian theology often presents Jesus's death as a sacrifice
      demanded by God to satisfy divine justice. God's holy and just nature requires
      that sin be dealt with. His righteousness demands satisfaction, and only Christ's
      substitutionary death can satisfy the demands of divine justice, allowing God to
      be both just and the justifier of believers. This is called
      <SteampunkTooltip variant="steel" :clickable="true">
        <template #content>
          Penal substitutionary atonement is the dominant theory in American evangelical Christianity, beginning with Martin Luther and developed in the Reformed tradition. It holds that Christ was punished (penalized) in the place of sinners (substitution) to satisfy God's justice. Proponents argue that God's holiness and justice are essential to His nature, and sin, as rebellion against God's character, requires atonement. On the cross, God takes upon Himself His own righteous demands, demonstrating how divine justice and divine love work together (Romans 3:25-26).

      </SteampunkTooltip>
      and it's the dominant view in American evangelical Christianity.
    </p>

    <p>
      The
      <SteampunkTooltip variant="steel" :clickable="true">
        <template #content>
          The non-sacrificial reading, developed through René Girard's mimetic theory, argues that the Gospels expose rather than participate in the scapegoat logic of archaic religion. Christ is both murdered by the mob (revealing the mechanism) and voluntarily gives himself in love (true self-sacrifice). The resurrection vindicates the victim, breaking the cycle and making future scapegoating increasingly difficult. Girard distinguishes between "bad sacrifice" (scapegoat murder disguised as divine requirement) and "good sacrifice" (voluntary self-giving that ends violence).

        <span>non-sacrificial reading</span>
      </SteampunkTooltip>
      says: that's backwards. God doesn't demand sacrifice. Humans demand sacrifice.
      The crucifixion exposes humanity's scapegoating mechanism rather than
      participating in its logic.
    </p>

    <p>
      Jesus dies not because God needs blood to forgive, but because humans, caught in
      mimetic rivalry and scapegoating, always kill the innocent and call it justice.
      But there's a crucial difference from all other scapegoats in history: Jesus
      voluntarily enters this pattern to break it from within, and the resurrection
      vindicates him, preventing the mob's version of events from standing unchallenged.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Passion reveals the innocence of the victim and the guilt of the mob. Jesus's
      words from the cross, "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do," are
      the key: they don't know. They think they're doing the right thing. That's how
      scapegoating always works.
    </p>

    <p>
      God isn't demanding the sacrifice. God is the victim of the sacrifice, revealing
      once and for all that this mechanism is built on a lie. And once revealed, the
      mechanism loses its power. Humanity can no longer scapegoat with unconscious
      innocence.
    </p>

    <h3>Why This Matters</h3>

    <p>This reading resolves many apparent contradictions in Scripture:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-inside mb-4 space-y-2">
      <li>
        Why does the Old Testament seem to show a violent God, while Jesus preaches love
        and forgiveness?
      </li>
      <li>How can God be love if He demands blood payment?</li>
      <li>
        Why does Jesus explicitly reject sacrifice and say "I desire mercy, not
        sacrifice" (Hosea 6:6, Matthew 9:13)?
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      The non-sacrificial reading says: God has always been non-violent and loving.
      What's changing through Scripture is human understanding of God, not God Himself.
      We're slowly learning to see God as He actually is, rather than projecting our own
      violence onto Him.
    </p>

    <h2>Tolstoyan Christian Anarchism: What It Actually Means</h2>

    <p>This is where people start thinking I'm crazy, but bear with me.</p>

    <p>
      I describe myself as a Tolstoyan Christian Anarchist. That sounds radical, but
      it's simply taking Jesus seriously when He says to turn the other cheek and love
      your enemies.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Christian Anarchism</strong> doesn't mean chaos. It means refusing to use
      violence, even state-sanctioned violence, to impose your will on others. It means
      focusing on the plank in your own eye instead of the speck in your brother's eye.
      It means recognizing that most of human history has been about people using
      violence (directly or through institutions) to control others, and that Jesus
      offers a different way.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Tolstoy</strong> articulated this vision brilliantly: true Christianity is
      fundamentally non-violent. When Jesus says "resist not evil," He means it. When He
      says to love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, He's not being
      metaphorical.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is profoundly different from both the political Right's vision of using state
      power to enforce Christian values and the political Left's vision of using state
      power to enforce their values. Both are still operating within the sacrificial
      logic: unite against a scapegoat, use violence (legal, economic, social) to expel
      them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Christian anarchism says: stop scapegoating. Stop using violence. Work on
      yourself. Love people. Trust God.
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm not saying I do this well. I fail at it constantly. But it's what I'm aiming
      for.

    <h2>The Problem of Scapegoating in Modern Culture</h2>

    <p>Once you see the scapegoating mechanism, you can't unsee it. It's everywhere.</p>

    <p>
      In politics, both sides are constantly looking for the enemy to unite against. For
      the Right, it's immigrants, or socialists, or the woke mob. For the Left, it's
      racists, or fascists, or the patriarchy. Both sides think they're fighting for
      justice, but they're perpetuating the cycle of mimetic violence.
    </p>

    <p>
      In social media, every controversy follows the same pattern. Someone says or does
      something offensive. The mob forms. Everyone competes to show they're more
      outraged than the next person. The target is destroyed, sometimes losing their
      livelihood. We all feel righteous and united. Until the next controversy, when we
      do it again.
    </p>

    <p>
      In workplaces, in churches, in families, the pattern repeats. Something goes
      wrong. Instead of addressing the genuine systemic issues, we find someone to
      blame. We expel them, literally or socially. Things seem better for a while. Then
      the underlying problems resurface because we never actually dealt with them.
    </p>

    <p>
      The non-sacrificial reading says: stop doing this. Stop looking for scapegoats.
      Stop trying to solve problems through expulsion and violence. Look at the actual
      issues. Take responsibility for your own part in the problems. Show mercy.
    </p>

    <p>
      This doesn't mean there are never genuine problems or that we should never
      confront bad behavior. But it means we need to do it from a place of love rather
      than a place of wanting to destroy the other person to feel better about
      ourselves.
    </p>

    <h2>How This Works in Practice</h2>

    <p>
      All of this theology is meaningless if it doesn't change how I actually live.
      Here's what it looks like in practice, though I fail at this constantly:
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In relationships:</strong> When conflict arises, I try to ask myself: Am I
      looking for someone to blame? Am I trying to unite people against a common enemy?
      What's my part in this? Instead of pointing out others' flaws, work on my own.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In politics:</strong> I don't vote. I don't try to capture state power to
      enforce my values. I focus on living differently myself and building community
      with others who want to do the same.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In church:</strong> I try to resist the urge to join in when people are
      gossiping or uniting against someone. I try to speak up for the person being
      scapegoated, even when it's uncomfortable.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>In work:</strong> When projects fail or problems arise, I try to look at
      systemic issues rather than blaming individuals. I try to create environments
      where people can grow rather than environments of fear and judgment.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>With myself:</strong> This is the hardest. I'm incredibly critical of
      myself, and I'm working on extending the same grace to myself that I try to show
      others.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fruits of the Spirit (love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
      faithfulness, gentleness, self-control) are what I'm aiming for. I struggle
      with all of them. But the framework gives me a way to understand why I struggle
      and what transformation actually looks like.
    </p>

    <p>
      This theological framework shapes everything, including how I approach my work and
      professional calling.
