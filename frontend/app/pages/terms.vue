            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              These terms are written to be understandable, not to bury you in legalese. They exist
              to protect both of us and set clear expectations about how the site works.

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              You're responsible for all activity that happens under your account. If someone
              else uses your account because you didn't keep it secure, that's on you. Choose
              a good password and don't share it.

              This is pretty simple: use the site for its intended purposes and don't be malicious.
              Specifically, you agree not to:

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Break any laws or regulations</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              You own the content you create on this site—your incident timers, phrase suggestions,
              profile information, and anything else you post. I don't claim ownership of your content.
            </p>

            <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-3">License to Use</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              However, by posting content, you grant me a license to use it for the site's operation.
              This means I can:

            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2 mb-4">
              <li>Store and display your content as part of the site features</li>

            </ul>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              This license ends when you delete your content or close your account, except for
              content you've explicitly made public (which may remain visible but disassociated
              from your account).
            </p>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              You're responsible for the content you post. Don't post anything illegal, infringing

              that violates these terms or is otherwise problematic.

              This is a personal project. I maintain it in my spare time while raising three kids

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
              To the maximum extent permitted by law, I'm not liable for any damages arising from
              your use of this site. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
              <li>Lost data or content</li>

            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              If, despite this limitation, I'm found liable for something, my total liability is
              limited to $100 or the amount you paid me (which is probably $0, since this is a
              free site), whichever is less.
            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
              Some jurisdictions don't allow these kinds of limitations, so they may not apply to
              you. But I'm putting them here because they're standard practice for personal projects.

              If you do something with this site that gets me sued or causes legal problems, you
              agree to cover my costs and defend me. This includes if you post illegal content,
              violate someone's rights, break these terms, or otherwise cause legal trouble through

              I reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to the site if you violate

              notice when practical, but I can terminate access immediately if necessary (for
              example, if you're actively attacking the site or other users).

              I may update these terms as the site evolves. If I make significant changes, I'll
              update the "Last Updated" date at the top and notify you via email if you have an
              account. Continued use of the site after changes means you accept the updated terms.

              If you don't agree with the changes, you should stop using the site and delete your

              regard to conflict of law principles. Any disputes will be resolved in the courts

            </p>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              That said, if there's a problem, please reach out to me first. I'd much rather work
              something out than end up in court. I'm approachable and reasonable, and most issues

              If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest of the terms still

                get along fine. If you have questions or concerns, I'm a real person and you can
